# Cowrie Crypto NFT Marketplace and Tutorial Application with Rails API 

## About 

This app is built with Ruby on Rails and uses Rails to work with an SQL database using Active Record ORM

The goal of this project is to create a tool that teachers can use with with secondary school students to help them understand the technology behind the blockchain while also learning about the creation of digital assets. It could be used by art/computer science teachers or fellow STEAM instructors. There are also several after-school programs that help students create digital artworks and sell them on the blockchain that could use this app to build context. This is simply for educational purposes and is not meant to be a block-chain based service. 

In this MVP version of the app, the app provides a database and web interface for admin to view, add, edit, and delete tutorials. Users can create collections and artworks, view artworks in the Cowry Marketplace, and make purchases of artworks in the marketplace. Purchases show up in the wallet with an associated NFT which has a 'unique' token (a random number between 1 and 30,000).

In its final version, it will allow users to make investments in Cowrie, view their wallet balance, and continue to view and purchase artworks with simulated NFTs on a simulated marketplace.

The app uses Cloudinary for image hosting. When creating collections, artworks, or tutorials, a user uploads images to Cloudinary via the Cloudinary API. 

## Features

More information on the database structure can be found at www.medium.com/laynaoyervides

- A separate React front-end application that interacts with the API to perform CRUD actions.
- At least four models with at least one join table. 
- The use of a complex database
- Styling using a design system (this uses Material Design: https://m2.material.io/design )
- Authentication using password encryption
- Authorization based on role (admin vs user)
- conditional routing on front end
- custom endpoints/routes to database
- search artworks using a db query

## Environment Setup

### Clone repository
Clone the project repository from github: https://github.com/laynaoyervides/hall-tracker-app

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/laynaoyervides/hall-tracker-app
```
### Install the Latest Ruby Version

Verify which version of Ruby you're running by entering this in the terminal:

```console
ruby -v
```
Make sure that the Ruby version you're running is listed in the supported runtimes by Heroku. At the time of writing, supported versions are 2.6.8, 2.7.4, or 3.0.2. Our recommendation is 2.7.4, but make sure to check the site for the latest supported versions.

If it's not, you can use rvm to install a newer version of Ruby:

```console
rvm install 2.7.4 --default
```
You should also install the latest versions of bundler and rails:

```console
gem install bundler
gem install rails
```
### Install NodeJS
Verify you are running a recent version of Node with:

```console
node -v
```
If your Node version is not 16.x.x, install it and set it as the current and default version with:

```console
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
nvm alias default 16
```
You can also update your npm version with:

```console
npm i -g npm
```
### Install SQLITE3 
Installing SQLite in OSX

If you are on OSX version 10.4 or greater, you probably already have SQLite installed. Find out by opening up the terminal and running:

```console
 which sqlite3
/usr/bin/sqlite3
```

If you see the output above, you have a working version of sqlite3 already installed on your system. Thanks Apple! Skip ahead to the 'SQLite VSCode Extension' section below!

If not, then there are a couple of ways you can install SQLite.

OSX: Install With Homebrew

You can install SQLite using Homebrew, which you should have installed as part of your Flatiron environment setup. Install SQLite with:
```console
 brew install sqlite
 ```
OSX: Install From Binary

If Homebrew isn't working out for you, you can download one of the pre-compiled binary packages available at the downloads pageLinks to an external site.. Look for your operating system, download and install the appropriate binary.

Note: If you are receiving an error when trying to install SQLite, make sure the Xcode Command-Line Tools have properly installed. Try running xcode-select --install to resolve this issue.

Installing SQLite in WSL

Below are the steps for installing SQLite on the Windows Sub-system for Linux:

Open your WSL terminal

Update your Ubuntu packages: sudo apt update

Once the packages have updated, install SQLite3 with: sudo apt install sqlite3
Confirm installation and get the version number: sqlite3 --version
For additional information, check out this article on getting started with databases in WSL

### Application Install
When you're ready to start building your project, run:

```console
bundle install
rails db:create
npm install --prefix client
```
###Server Start
You can use the following commands to run the application:
```console
rails db:migrate 
db:seed 
```
migrate and seed the database 
(use db:seed:replant if this is not the first time running)

```console
rails s: run the backend on http://localhost:3000
npm start --prefix client: 
```
run the frontend on http://localhost:4000

### Backend Shutdown
It should be possible to shutdown the server using [CTRL-C]. If that fails, follow these steps:

```console
lsof -i tcp:9292 response: COMMAND PID USER .... ruby 1234 root ....
kill -9 1234
```
