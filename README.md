#Cowrie Crypto NFT Marketplace and Tutorial Application with Rails API 

About 
This app is built with Ruby on Rails and uses Rails to work with an SQL database using Active Record ORM

In this MVP version of the app, the app provides a database and web interface for admin to view, add, edit, and delete tutorials. Users can create collections and artworks, view artworks in the Cowry Marketplace, and make purchases of artworks in the marketplace. Purchases show up in the wallet with an associated NFT which has a 'unique' token (a random number between 1 and 30,000).

In its final version, it will allow users to make investments in Cowrie, view their wallet balance, and continue to view and purchase artworks with simulated NFTs on a simulated marketplace.

The goal of this project is to create a tool that teachers can use with with secondary school students to help them understand the technology behind the blockchain while also learning about the creation of digital assets. It could be used by art/computer science teachers or fellow STEAM instructors. There are also several after-school programs that help students create digital artworks and sell them on the blockchain. This is simply for educational purposes and is not meant to be a block-chain based service.
